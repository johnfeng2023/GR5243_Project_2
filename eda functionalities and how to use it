Descriptive Statistical Analysis: This component generates comprehensive numerical summaries of quantitative variables, including measures of central tendency (mean, median), dispersion (standard deviation, interquartile range), and distribution characteristics (minimum, maximum, quartiles). These statistics provide foundational insights into the underlying data distributions and potential outliers.
Structural Metadata Analysis: This module examines the dataset's structural properties, quantifying variable types, cardinality (unique value counts), and data completeness metrics. The systematic assessment of missing data patterns (both absolute and relative frequencies) enables researchers to evaluate data quality and potential biases prior to advanced analyses.
Univariate Distribution Analysis: This component implements visualization techniques optimized for different variable types. For continuous variables, the system generates histograms with adaptive binning algorithms to appropriately represent underlying distributions. For categorical variables, frequency distribution plots highlight predominant categories and potential class imbalances.
Bivariate Relationship Analysis: This module facilitates the examination of variable interactions through scatter plot visualizations with multiple parameterization options. The implementation includes regression modeling capabilities (both parametric linear and non-parametric LOWESS approaches), outlier detection algorithms based on standardized residuals, and multivariate encoding through color mapping.
Multivariate Correlation Analysis: This component generates correlation matrices with adjustable significance thresholds to identify statistically meaningful relationships within the dataset. The implementation supports multiple correlation methodologies (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall) to accommodate various data characteristics and distribution assumptions.
